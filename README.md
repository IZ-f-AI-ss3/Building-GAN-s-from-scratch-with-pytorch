# Building-GAN-s-from-scratch-with-pytorch
In this repository, I have implemented a GAN using the celeb_faces dataset . 
It’s been a while since I completed this notebook, so I’m excited to dive back into it! I plan to make improvements over time, similar to my previous project.
Among these improvements, I’ll be exploring better architectures (the initial architecture was chosen somewhat randomly) and incorporating spectral normalization, which I found intriguing after seeing the results related in the article.
